Privacy Policy for Trigon Evo

Last Updated: 01/10/2023

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains the personal data that Trigon Evo ("Bot", "we", "our", or "us") collects, why we collect it, and how we use and handle the said data.

1. Data We Collect
    - User Messages: We collect user messages solely for the purpose of enabling the prefix command functionality.
    - Warn Command: Our Bot employs the 'warn' command, which records usernames based on guild IDs and stores them persistently in a secure database.
    - Action Logs: The 'action logs' command is used by server staff to log and record actions, such as bans, kicks, and warnings. This guild-specific data is stored in our secure database.
    - Modlogs: The 'modlogs' command lets users check their moderation history. This guild-specific data is stored in our secure database.
    - Snipe Command: We temporarily store deleted messages and the associated channel ID when the 'snipe' command is used.
    - No Additional Data Collection: We do not collect any other personal data or information beyond what is mentioned above.

2. How We Use the Data
    - The data collected is exclusively used to provide the features and functionalities of the Bot. It is not used for any other purposes and is not shared with third parties.

3. Data Retention
    - Data associated with the 'snipe' command is stored temporarily and is automatically purged after a short period.
    - Data linked with the 'warn', 'action logs', and 'modlogs' commands is stored persistently in a secure database but is guild-specific, ensuring that data is compartmentalized based on individual server needs.

4. Data Security
    - We employ appropriate measures to protect the security of the data we collect. We take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of data.

5. User's Rights
    - Users have the right to inquire about the data we collect and request deletion of any data associated with them. To make such requests or inquiries, users can contact us at forever4d@outlook.com

6. Changes to This Policy
    - We reserve the right to update or change this Policy at any time. Any significant changes will be notified to users through appropriate channels. By continuing to use the Bot after these changes are made, you agree to the revised Policy.

7. Contact Information
    - For questions, comments, or concerns regarding this Policy, please contact us at forever4d@outlook.com.

By using Trigon Evo, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
