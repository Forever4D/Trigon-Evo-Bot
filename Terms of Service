Welcome to Trigon Evo. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to safeguard it when you use our bot.

2. Information We Collect

In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us.

Personal Information Provided by You:
- Usernames: For command execution and moderation functions.
- Message Contents: Specifically, for real-time command processing and for reasons provided in moderation actions.
- Server IDs: To specify and segregate command actions per server.
- Moderation Reasons: To provide clarity and record-keeping on moderation actions taken.

3. Why We Collect This Data

We primarily collect and use this data to ensure the proper and effective functioning of Trigon Evo within your Discord server. Storing specific data helps in understanding user interaction, ensures command accuracy, and offers tailored moderation assistance for each server.

4. How We Use Your Data:

- To Facilitate Commands: Your data aids in processing specific commands and executing functionalities seamlessly.

- For Moderation: To assist server administrators in maintaining a harmonious environment within their servers.

5. Data Storage & Retention

All the data we collect is stored securely with state-of-the-art encryption methods. We retain collected data for a maximum of 90 days, post which it is automatically deleted. Message contents used for real-time command processes are not stored beyond immediate use. However, users cannot request the deletion of their individual warning logs, as they are integral to server moderation and maintaining a secure environment. Server administrators, however, have the ability to delete their own server's moderation logs as required.

Users have the right to inquire about the data we hold about them. While individual warning logs are exempted from deletion requests to maintain server integrity, users can contact us if they have concerns regarding other stored data.
- Transparency: Users can inquire about their stored data by reaching out to our support.
- Deletion: Post the stipulated retention period, data is automatically deleted. However, server admins can invoke specific commands to remove data prematurely.
